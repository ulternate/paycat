# Paycat
Categorise tap and pay payments for budgeting and spend tracking.

## What it does?

**Paycat** will listen for notifications from payments on your Android device using services like Android Pay or Paypal. Each notification will be captured and categorised. This will allow the following:

* Know exactly how much you're spending on Coffee (Groceries, movies...).
* Capture transaction information without needing to scan receipts.
* Budget effectively.

## What apps are supported?

Currently only Android Pay is supported, but other payment apps are planned.
**Paycat** relies on the payment app notifying you of the transaction. This notification is parsed by **Paycat** and stored. Each app needs to be tested to ensure parsing is supported and the information is consistent.
